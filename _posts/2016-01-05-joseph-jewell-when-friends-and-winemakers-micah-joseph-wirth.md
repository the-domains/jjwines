Joseph Jewell When friends and winemakers Micah Joseph Wirth and Adrian Jewell Manspeaker teamed up in 2006, they made their first wine together in a Windsor garage. With two French oak barrels, a small basket press, and exactly one ton of Russian River Valley grapes, they produced 50 cases of single-vineyard Pinot Noir. With no winery affiliation or property of their own, they combined their middle names for the new venture and pooled their resources to build their own wine company dedicated to capturing the unique terroir of single-vineyard sites. The success of that first release enabled Micah and Adrian to invest seriously in their project and grow their garage experiment to a 2500-case production of exceptional wines. With their tasting room now open in the charming town of Forestville, on Front Street, you can often find Adrian or Micah behind the counter ready to share their knowledge and enhance the quality of your experience while tasting the beautiful wines, making it an unforgettable time at Joseph Jewell wines. We look forward to seeing you soon.
