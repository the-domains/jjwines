WINERIES TO WATCH Wineries to Watch Top » Wineries to Watch » 2014 » Joseph Jewell Sonoma's Russian River Valley: Joseph Jewell by Luke Sykora    luke\_sykora This winery to watch was featured in W&S's Winter 2014 issue. DON'T MISS STORIES. FOLLOW WINE & SPIRITS Follow on FacebookFollow on TwitterFollow on Instagram Micah Joseph Wirth and Adrian Jewell Manspeaker made their first wine together in 2006, purchasing one ton of Russian River pinot noir from the Oakwild Vineyard and fermenting it in a Sonoma County garage. Wirth was working at Gary Farrell at the time, and though Manspeaker had no winemaking experience, he jumped at the chance to get involved. They made their first commercial vintage in 2007---300 cases---and have slowly expanded, focusing on Russian River pinot noir. They continue to do all the cellar work themselves, bottling unfiltered wines that stand out for their delicacy and restraint in a region that sometimes pushes pinot noir in a ripe and showy direction. Try their basic 2012 Russian River Pinot Noir: It's fantastic, firm and bright with dazzling woodland aromas. Imported by Joseph Jewell Wines, Cloverdale, CA.
