On Saturday, July 11thwe invite club members to have a closer look at what makes the wines of Joseph Jewell so delicious and unique. We have an incredible afternoon planned for you, and you will not want to miss it.

From 2:30-4:00pm, John Bucher from Bucher Vineyard will be in our tasting room will be here to discuss the qualities that make his vineyard so exquisite. Bucher Vineyard is the newest source of Pinot Noir for Joseph Jewell, and our first vintage of this stunning single-vineyard wine will be 2014\. Best yet, we will be pouring this yet-to-be released wine for our club members. Come and taste the future of Joseph Jewell Wines!
