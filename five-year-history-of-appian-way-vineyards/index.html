It has Gold Ridge soil, which has a well-draining, fine, sandy loam on the surface and a subsoil of golden-yellow sandy loam and fractured sandstone. This type of soil is derived from the remains of an ancient inland sea that slowly emptied into the Pacific three to five million years ago; it’s particularly valuable for high-quality wine grape production because of its excellent drainage and low soil fertility.\n \nThe vineyard is located in the Russian River Valley, just off Highway 116 between Forestville and Graton—the heart of “Pinot Country.” It is also across the street from Gary Farrell’s old vineyard Cresta Ridge, which has been making some of our favorite Pinot Noirs for some time. With close proximity to the coast, the location couldn’t get any better. This part of the Russian River Valley sees a lot of summertime fog, which keeps the grapes nice and cool and allows the fruit to mature at a slow rate. Combined with its diversity of clones, we knew that Appian Way Vineyards offered all the necessary components to craft complex Pinot Noir, and we quickly committed to purchasing the half-ton available for sale.\n \nSince 2007, Appian Way Vineyards has been the source of Joseph Jewell’s commercially produced Pinot Noirs.
