The location of these vineyards plays a huge role in our selection process. We source fruit from independently owned properties in Sonoma and Humboldt counties, selecting sites with the most ideal soil and weather conditions for the varietal we intend to produce. As part of our commitment to the future, we seek out growers who apply sustainable farming practices. We work closely with the property owners throughout the year to monitor the grapes’ progress and cultivate the distinctive character of the site. Our goal is a finished wine that celebrates the individuality of the vineyard from which it came—the optimal expression of place.</p><p>RUSSIAN RIVER VALLEY</p><h5>Appian Way Vineyards</h5><p>Appian Way Vineyards is situated just outside of the town of Forestville. The property was farmed as an organic apple orchard until 2001, when the owners removed the trees and replanted several acres with three different clones of Pinot Noir grapes (clones 115, 777 and Pommard). This two-acre vineyard boasts what is known as Goldridge soil, which is a fine sandy loam with excellent drainage. Over a lengthy wine-fueled dinner, we managed to convince owners Tom and Kelly Keegan that we would handle their fruit with the utmost care. We consider ourselves very fortunate to include this vineyard in our portfolio.</p><h5>Floodgate Vineyard</h5><p>Floodgate Vineyard is located in the northern part of the Russian River Valley AVA, within the unofficial sub-region known as the Middle Reach. The vineyard property borders Mark West Creek, which floods every year and submerges the flat areas of the vineyard. We source our fruit from three different blocks of Pinot Noir: Block 12 (planted to clone 777), Block 6 (planted to clone 667), and Block 7B (planted to clone 115). This vineyard is owned by Hambrecht Vineyards and farmed by Warren Burton.</p><h5>Hallberg Vineyard</h5><p>This stunning site bears the name of the former owners, Don and Marcia Hallberg. In 1999, with aging apple trees past their prime, they sold the 115-acre orchard to Emeritus Vineyards. Boasting soils and climate ideal for growing Pinot Noir, the land was returned to vineyards after 65 years and the Hallberg name continues as a hallmark of Russian River Valley agriculture. Current vineyard manager Kirk Lokka has a keen eye for detail and knows the vines better that anyone.</p><h5>Shiloh Hill Vineyard</h5><p>This steeply terraced, west-facing hillside vineyard is located at the eastern edge of the Russian River Valley. Rocky volcanic soils, cool morning fog, and warm sunny afternoons make this site of the most unique Chardonnay sites in the region. Owned by Les and Jo Lesniak and farmed in collaboration with Marcelo Chavez, the vineyard was planted in 1990 to UC Davis clones 4 and 5. The fully mature vines are producing elegant, nuanced fruit with a full range of aromatics and flavors.</p><p>DRY CREEK VALLEY</p><h5>Grist Vineyard</h5><p>At 1000 feet above sea level at the top of Bradford Mountain, the Grist Vineyard in Dry Creek Valley is where we source our Zinfandel. The vineyard, which was planted in 1974, consists of red volcanic soils and receives lots of direct sunlight. The property is owned by Hambrecht Vineyards and farmed by Warren Burton, an experienced and eminently well-qualified Kiwi. In order to ensure even ripening, which is difficult with Zinfandel, Warren regularly drops unripe clusters and maintains the crop load at around only two tons per acre.</p><p>HUMBOLDT COUNTY</p><h5>Elk Prairie Vineyard</h5><p>Perched at 1200 feet elevation on Fruitland Ridge in Humboldt County, Elk Prairie Vineyard is the most northern and highest elevation site in our portfolio. The dense fog that creeps up from Humboldt Bay allows both wine grapes and Redwood trees to flourish. At one time the largest tree in the world, the “Dyerville Giant”, stood just a few miles from this site. Summer temperatures are very mild here, typically in the high 70’s to low 80’s, and only rarely reach 90 degrees. These moderate temperatures encourage the densely planted vines to ripen slowly and achieve a greater complexity and balance.</p></div></section></div><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-vibrant colors-global " data-reactid="31"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="32"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="33"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="34"><span data-reactid="35"><!-- react-empty: 36 --><h2 data-reactid="37"><a data-reactid="38">Our Vineyards</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="39"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="40"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="41"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="42"></div></section></div></div>
